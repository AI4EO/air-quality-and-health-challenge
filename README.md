# Air Quality and Health Challenge

Welcome to the AI4EO Air Quality and Health Challenge!! 

This repository contains a [Jupyter notebook](starter-pack.ipynb) and [utility functions](utils.py) to get you started exploring and analysing the data. Simply clone the repository or download the files. For a more user-friendly version, visualise the [notebook in nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/AI4EO/air-quality-and-health-challenge/blob/main/starter-pack.ipynb) 

## Requirements

In order to run the example notebook you would need to download the training and validation datasets, and set-up the Docker environment provided with read/write permissions to the datasets. To do so, do the following:

 * download the Docker image provided;
 * load the image running from terminal `sudo docker load < ai4eo-public.tar `;
 * run the docker using the utility bash script `sh run_ai4eo_uhost.sh`;
 * attach the container `sudo docker container attach ai4eo-container-uhost`;
 * from within the attached container terminal run JupyterLab `jupyter lab --ip 0.0.0.0 --port 8888 --no-browser`;
 * click on one of the links to JupyterLab home and you are ready to go.
